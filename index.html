            <h2>Hi! I'm Aaryan Poudel.</h2> 
            <p>Call it mainstream but I'm really into anything tech. This interest pushed me towards <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>.</p>
            <p>In this field, it's a must to be constantly updated. It's not a chore to do that. Rather, it's a new problem to solve, a new language to learn and a new framework to implement for me. It's a new opportunity everyday.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What's my qualification?</h3>
            <p>I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering student. I'm pursuing the engineering degree from <strong>Kathmandu Engineering College (KEC)</strong>, Kalimati, Kathmandu, Nepal.
            <p>I completed my high schooling from National Integrated College (NIC), Dillibazar, Kathmandu. The schooling was completed form Meridian International School, Baluwatar, Kathmandu.</p>
            <h3>What are my career goals?</h3>
            <p>The goal for now is to be a <strong>full-stack developer</strong>. Currently, I've been focusing on the front-end side of things. After mastering a fron-end framework of choice, I'll move towards the back-end.</p>
            <p>I've dipped my toes into mobile app development as well. But looking at the market trend, the mobile app market already seems to be saturated. Also, which developer from the last decade won't be trying out Machine Learing?</p>
            <h3>Hobbies?</h3>
            <p>Music all day everyday, specially from the era of Floyd, Zeppelin and The Beatles. I'm a <strong>guitar player</strong></strong> with inspirations such as D. Gilmour and John Mayer.</p>
            <p>Every other person is Casey Neistat now. I'm into Photo/Videography as well. I'm on the trial and error phase of finding my own color grading style. Recently, I've weaved together my interest for music with videography by recording full songs and producing a video for it.</p>
