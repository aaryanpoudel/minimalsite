                    <p class='article-body'>I've worked as the program host of the show Idea Astra, which aired in National Television(NTV). It's a program meant to get kids interested in DIY projects. Just like we were grabbed by shows like Art Attack and Backyard Science, Idea Astra aimed to do a similar stuff for the Nepali audience. The program aired weekly on friday. It was an amazing experience, which also got me interested in videography.</p>
